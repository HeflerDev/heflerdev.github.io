# RP1 Message Dispatch System (Microservice)

The **RP1 Message Dispatch System** is a **high-performance microservice** designed for **real-time message operations**.  
It was built using advanced **Node.js features** such as **subprocesses, clustering, and modular architecture**, supporting massive throughput and horizontal scalability.

## Key Features

- ‚ö° **Real-time dispatch** of messages with high concurrency support.
- üóÑÔ∏è Optimized **MongoDB queries** with tailored indexing strategies for **100M+ records**.
- üß© Built as a **microservice**, ensuring modularity and maintainability.
- üß† **Redis in-memory processing** for caching and fast lookups.
- üîÑ Legacy query restructuring for improved performance under **heavy load**.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js** with **TypeScript**
- **MongoDB** (optimized with custom indexes)
- **Redis** (in-memory caching & processing)
- **Microservices architecture**
