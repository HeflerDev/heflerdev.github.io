Henrique Hefler is a brilliant DevOps engineer who can solve any problem with ease and efficiency. I had the pleasure of working with him for seven months at Good Software Dev, where he was in charge of automating the pipelines for deploying Docker containers. He showed great expertise in managing servers and virtual machines, and he was always up to date with the latest technologies and best practices.

He improved the performance, reliability, and security of our applications by implementing continuous integration and delivery, monitoring, and testing tools. Henrique was a valuable member of our team who always delivered high-quality work on time and within budget. He was also a great mentor and collaborator who shared his knowledge and insights with others. He helped us streamline our processes, reduce errors, and increase customer satisfaction.

I highly recommend Henrique for any DevOps role that requires creativity, innovation, and excellence. He is a true asset to any organization and a pleasure to work with.

**Back-End Developer @GoodSoftwareDev | TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Ruby on Rails, Mocha, Redis, RabbitMQ, AWS | Dedicated to continuous learning**  
*Henrique's coworker from Oct 14, 2023*  

Working with Hefler for the last one year has been one of the very best experiences in my professional life and now I am here to recommend Hefler for any Backend and especially DevOps related jobs. His calm and composed nature nurtures a positive attitude in the team and his eagerness to deliver the best possible product makes him very reliable.

I am really amazed that throughout tenure I have been asking to deploy new technologies which he was not experienced with at all and he spent days and nights deploying them to perfection within the deadline. I again strongly recommend Hefler for any sort of team that is looking for a calm, passionate and responsible developer.
